Each bandit has different success probabilities for each arm, and as such requires different actions to obtain the best result. The pullBandit function generates a random number from a normal distribution with a mean of 0. The lower the bandit number, the more likely a positive reward will be returned. We want our agent to learn to always choose the bandit-arm that will most often give a positive reward, depending on the Bandit presented."
