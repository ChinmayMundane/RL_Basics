## Structure
This repo includes 
- Pytorch notes and its implementations
- Classic RL algorithms
- notes I made going through the resources.
- training and testing a RL agent in multiple environment in metadrive simulator(open source autonomous driving simulator)

## Execution


 You can run the test codes normally on google collab or jupyter notebook

 - For RL training and scripts
  - install [metadrive](https://metadrive-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
  - move the "set_1 folder under metadrive/examples"
  - cd under the metadrive and run
  ```
  python -m metadrive.examples.file_name
  ```
(Remember to comment out some part of codes to customise the settings)
